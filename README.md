Alfred 2 Helpers and Workflows
=========

This repository contains my created Alfred 2 (http://www.alfredapp.com) workflows:

Leo Dictionary
---------
![Searching with leo](Leo%20Dictionary/screenshot_de.png)

Searches the Leo dictionary (http://dict.leo.org) for the languages german and english and feeds back the results into Alfred for instantly seeing the translated word. When hitting 'Enter' the translated word is copied to the clipboard.

There are two ways to search Leo:
* de - The 'de' keyword will search for the german translation of an english word.
* en - The 'en' keyword searches for the english transation of a german word.

Release Notes:
V 1.1:
- Added two hotkey inputs, transferring the current selected text to Alfred for getting translation. The used hotkeys are not imported and need to be set as wished.
